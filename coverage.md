# Coverage Research
Statement Coverage, Branch Coverage, and Predicate Coverage are metrics used in software testing to evaluate the thoroughness of test suites and determine how well the code has been exercised. These metrics help assess the quality of testing by measuring the extent to which different parts of the code have been executed.

## Statement Coverage
This metric focuses on the execution of individual code statements. It measures the percentage of statements in the code that have been executed at least once during the testing process. It is a basic metric that ensures that every line of code has been tested.

## Branch Coverage
Branch coverage goes a step further by considering control flow decisions in the code. It evaluates the percentage of decision points (branches) that have been exercised by tests. It aims to ensure that all possible outcomes of conditional statements have been tested.

## Predicate Coverage 
Predicate coverage is a more fine-grained metric that looks at the different conditions within decision points. It measures the percentage of conditions (predicates) within branches that have been evaluated to both true and false during testing.
